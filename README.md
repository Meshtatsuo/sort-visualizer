# sort-visualizer

A sorting algorithm visualizer built in Python

# Features

The sort-visualizer currently supports the following algorithms:

<ul>
<li>Bubble Sort</li>
<li>Insertion Sort</li>
</ul>

With plans to introduce more down the road!

# Usage

To use this project you must have Python installed on your machine (built in Python 3)!

The visualizer takes in 2 command line arguments to determine sort type and dataset size and the syntax is as follows:

`python main.py [sort type] [dataset size]`

For example, if you wish to visualize a bubble sort with a dataset size of 50, you would launch the application using this syntax:

`python main.py bubble 50`

Note: sort type is not case sensitive!
